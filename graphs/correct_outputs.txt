The graphs series of graphs are used to check the code's correctness. Except for internal tiebreaking by the solver, each result is deterministic.

graph1:
A	B	D
B	D	D

graph2:
A	B	D
B	D	D 

graph3: deals with tiebreaking
A	C	D
C	D	D

graph4:
A	B	D
B	D	D

graph5:
A	B	U
B	D	U

graph6: 
A	B	U
B	D	U

graph7: deals with tiebreaking
A	B	U
B	D	U

graph8:
A	B	U
B	D	U

graph9: 
A	B	D
B	D	U

graph10:
A	B	D
B	D	D

graph11:
A	B	U
B	D	U

graph12:
A	B	D
B	D	D

graph13:
A	B	U
B	D	U

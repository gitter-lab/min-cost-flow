The tests series of graphs are used to verify whether the code is executing appropriately depending on distinct edge cases.

test 1: check if unique directed edges are added to directed_dict 
Output:
A	B	D
B	C	D

test2: check if higher edge weight is selected for the same directed edge from the input
Output:
A	B	D
B	C	D

test3: If a directed edge is present in the input and an undirected edge from that edge already exists, the directed edge is prioritized and added to directed_dict and the undirected edge is deleted from undirected_dict.
Output:
B   C   D
A   B   D

test4: check if unique undirected edges are added to undirected_dict 
Output:
A	B	U
B	C	U

test5: check that an undirected edge is not added if a directed edge of that edge already exists
Output:
A	B	D
B	C	D

test6: check if higher edge weight is selected for the same undirected edge from the input
Output:
A	B	U
B	C	U

test7: check that code still runs and outputs an error message with an empty edges.txt
Output:
N/A
